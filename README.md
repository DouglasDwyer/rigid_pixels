# rigid_pixels

Rigid pixels is a toy 2D physics engine based on [Ian Millington's *Game Physics Engine Development*](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768). It implements 2D versions of the collision detection techniques described by Dennis Gustafsson in the [Teardown Technical Teardown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VzE8ROwC58). My goal with this project was to implement a proper iterative collision resolver, in the hopes of porting it to my [3D voxel engine](https://github.com/DouglasDwyer/octo-release).
